		Everything is gaussian
		Everything you measure has a width and a mean
		Everything is gaussian: central limit theorem
\endverse
\beginverse	
		Nobody likes the poisson distribution
		Binomial is worse and we need a solution, what's the solution?
		N is big, P is small, you will see, your data will set you free

		(Wooo)
		3, 2, 1. Go

		Barlow and Taylor, they're just awesome
		Stat. made easy 'cause everything is Gaussian!
		Take the limit, N to infinity
		Convergence is guaranteed thanks to entropy
\endverse
\beginverse	
		I drew some awesome super pretty Gaussians
		Put my data into histograms
		while I listen to my favorit' jams
		Fittin' all the functions, everything is gaussian
		Changed the axes, got a new view
		It's gaussian to fit, and it's gaussian to do (It's gaussian to do)

\beginverse	
		Bell curves, height of kings
		We just named two gaussian things
		Women's shoe size', table lengths
		You know what's gaussian? EVERYTHING!
\endverse
\beginverse	
		IQ tests, velocities,
		Number of people's allergies
		Wolfowitz' and Chi square test
		gasssian items are the best!
\endverse
\beginverse	
		Bells, Hills, Mills,
		They're gaussian
		Socks, Clocks and Rocks
		They're gaussian!
		Per Hede-g√•rd
		He's gaussian!
		Everything you see, or think, or say
		Is gaussian!
