\beginverse
 When a man likes a woman
I want to see you every night
Do anything
Just to receive your love
\endverse

\beginverse
If you are bad, I want to see it
'Cause love makes you blind
Though you turn your back on me
I will hunt you down
\endverse

\beginverse
When I'm stalking you on facebook
I view your pictures all the time
Checking out your likes
To plan our date
\endverse

\beginverse
Sitting just hoping for a selfie
And posting on your wall
Making my parrot say
"I love you babe"
\endverse

\beginverse
Well, this man stalks you, woman
I serenade you in the rain
Playing my cowbell to catch your heart love
Baby, why are you not home?
\endverse

\beginverse
When I'm stalking you on facebook
Tryin' to be your friend
Oh, please tell me why...
... are you blocking me?
\endverse

\beginverse
When I'm stalking you on facebook
Named my pet after you
You're my starting page
I want you babe
\endverse

\beginverse
(Oh) When I'm sleeping with your profile
Why would you cut your hair?
Lovin' eyes
Can always see
\endverse

\beginverse
(Yes) When I'm stalking you on facebook
Oh, why did that policeman come?
Baby, baby, baby
You're my world
\endverse

\beginverse
When I'm stalking you on facebook
When I'm stalking you on facebook
When I'm stalking you on facebook
When I'm stalking you on facebook...
\endverse
