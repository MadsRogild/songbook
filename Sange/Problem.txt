\beginverse
 Uh huh!
It's (rappers navn)!
I got one more problem for you girl
One less one less!
Problem
\endverse

\beginverse
 Why I'm not scared of my exam is,
'Cus Im'ma pass this
I might get "A++"
And even though a lot will fail this,
I'm gonna ace this,
I want an "A++"
\endverse

\beginverse
Come on, come on brain, please
I’ve got to solve these
Cause even though this should be quite hard
I’m never off guard
I want A++
\endverse

\beginverse
Pen in my hand
Yea, my answer is brilliant
I am the wisest
My results will prove that
\endverse

\beginverse
 One less problem to solve now!
I got!
One less problem to solve now!
I got!
One less problem to solve now!

\endverse

\beginverse
 I got one less, one less problem
\endverse

\beginverse
\endverse

\beginverse
 I know that I can make this flawless
And so with no stress
I’ll get A++
I know I shouldn’t ever be sure
But I’m not unsure
I’ll get A++
Every time I do math
I know I love math
I get a little bit higher
I just can’t help it
I’ll get A++!

\beginverse
 It's straight A+
\endverse

\beginverse
What you got?
Check my solution
I'll be cruisin' right all over this
In no time
I'll write geniusness all over this
I'm saying that I know
And you better not be doubtin' this
'cus life couldn't be easier,
I'm practically obsessed with this,
Killer feeling
Of leaving the censor reeling
Can't help but love the thought of him
Knowing I know I'm dealing
In the best damn thing
To ever leave this classroom
Hand it in
Get my A
I know, I learned my lessons!
No wrong answers
I let others, bask in my glory
I'm waiting 'round expecting my
A number forty
There's a million other math folks,
But none as smart
I got 99 problems
And they aren't hard
Like what!
